Tic Tac Toe Python is a two player game where the grid size is resizable up to 9x9. The purpose of this project is for my learning to code in Python with the help of Youtuber sentdex's tutorial for this project

Instead of copy paste the whole code from the tutorial, I took the initiative to improve the code to cover:
* edge cases (if player enters invalid input, they get another try)
* change the column grid from Numeric (0,1,2) to Alphabet (A,B,C)
* using colorama library, add color of the win message correspond to the player's color (eg. player1 **GREEN**, player2 **MAGENTA**)
* refactor code and add documentation and comments

## Project Takeaway
* how to install and use package (itertools, colorama) from pip
* Built-in Functions, such as reversed(), enumerate(), range()
* Loops, Functions, Exceptions
* naming conventions for Function and Variable Names: underscore [def this_is_function(), my_variable]
